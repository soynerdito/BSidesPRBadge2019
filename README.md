# BSidesPR Badge 2019
As part of BSidesPR we like to share a badge with participants. Ideally eveyone will have a badge to take home. Some times we might run out of badges. Still we strive for success.

## CPU
Badge uses one Atmega16U2 microcontroller. Minimal hardware is included in badge.

At the moment of publishing this repository it is unknown if this design will persist. Mostly due to it's cost and ensabling options.
